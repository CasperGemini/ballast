Ballast Installation and Configuration
======================================

1. Deployments

    A Ballast deployment consists of:
    
        o A Ballast agent on each host to be load balanced to collect
          load information
          
        o A Ballast server on one or more hosts to process load
          information and select hosts for clients based on configured
          policies
        
        o A Ballast client on each host that will invoke the balancer to
          request balancing decisions from the server

    Any number of load balancing aliases can be defined for any number
    of hosts.  For example, an alias "foo" might be used to invoke the
    load balancer across hosts {foo1,foo2,bar1,bar2}.  Namely, when the
    user invokes "ssh foo", Ballast will dynamically select one of
    {foo1,foo2,bar1,bar2} according to the configured load balancing
    policy for alias foo and connect to that system (e.g. foo2) as if
    the user had directly invoked "ssh foo2".


2. Prerequisites

    2.1. Host keys

        All SSH host keys across the balanced systems for a particular
        alias must be identical.  Otherwise, internal SSH host key
        checks will fail when the stored known host key for the alias
        does not match the host key offered by the selected host.  See
        "man sshd" and "man sshd_config" for details on configuring
        host keys.

        If multiple balancing aliases are defined, the host keys may
        differ between the hosts of different aliases.

    2.2. Ballast agent

        o Perl >= 5.8

    2.3. Ballast client

        2.3.1. Perl client

            o Perl >= 5.6

        2.3.2. C client

            o C      (compilation only)
            o Make   (compilation only)
            o Netcat (or equivalent such as tcpconnect from tcputils)

    2.4. Ballast server

        o Perl >= 5.8


3. Build

    3.1. Ballast C client (optional)

        The Ballast client comes in two flavors: Perl and C.  If Perl is
        installed and available to users, the Perl version is
        recommended.  The C version is intended for systems that either
        don't have Perl installed or for which it is not generally
        accessible to users (e.g. bastion hosts with a restricted
        chroot environment).

        To build the C client, run:

            make

        The Makefile assumes gcc and may need to be modified if an
        alternate compiler is installed.

    3.2. Debian package (optional)

        An optional Debian package can be built at the top of the source
        directory using:

            dpkg-buildpackage -B

        After the command completes, a .deb file should exist in the
        parent directory.  The file name will vary depending on the
        Ballast version, but will be in the general form
        "ballast_VERSION-REL_ARCH.deb".


4. Installation

    4.1. Debian package installation

        If the Debian package has been built, the package file can be
        installed to prefix /usr using:

            dpkg -i ballast*.deb

        Note that this installs the Perl client.  The C client must be
        installed manually, if desired.  

    4.2. Make installation

        If the "make" command is available on the system, the different
        components can be installed via make.  The installation prefix
        can be changed from the default "/usr/local" to a different
        location by adjusting the value of the "PREFIX" variable in
        "Makefile".

        To install all components (except for C client), run:

            make install

        For component X in {agent, client, c_client, server}, X can be
        installed using:

            make install_X

        For example, the install the standard Perl client, run:

            make install_client

        After either the agent or server is installed on a systemd
        host, the following must be run:

            systemctl daemon-reload

    4.3. Manual installation

        Files can be installed manually as given below.  Note that
        /usr/local is used as the default install prefix in all
        examples, but can be changed to any other desired location.
        The location of the config file can also be changed from
        /etc/ballastrc, but then requires that the agent, client, and/or
        server be invoked with additional parameters "-c
        /path/to/config/file".

        After either the agent or server is installed on a systemd
        host, the following must be run:

            systemctl daemon-reload

        4.3.1. Ballast agent installation

            On each host to be load balanced:

                install -m 755 perl/ballast-agent /usr/local/sbin/
                install -m 644 etc/ballastrc /etc/
                # To install relevant documentation:
                install -m 644 doc/ballast-agent.1 /usr/local/man/man1/
                install -m 644 doc/ballastrc.5 /usr/local/man/man5/
                # If the Ballast agent will be run via systemd timer:
                install -m 644 etc/systemd/system/ballast-agent.service /etc/systemd/system/
                install -m 644 etc/systemd/system/ballast-agent.timer /etc/systemd/system/

        4.3.2. Ballast client installation

            On each host that will invoke the balancer:

                # change to c/ballast if using the C client
                install -m 755 perl/ballast /usr/local/bin/
                install -m 644 etc/ballastrc /etc/
                # To install relevant documentation:
                install -m 644 doc/ballast.1 /usr/local/man/man1/
                install -m 644 doc/ballastrc.5 /usr/local/man/man5/

        4.3.3. Ballast server installation

            On one or more hosts:

                install -m 755 perl/ballastd /usr/local/sbin/
                install -m 644 etc/ballastrc /etc/
                # To install relevant documentation:
                install -m 644 doc/ballastd.1 /usr/local/man/man1/
                install -m 644 doc/ballastrc.5 /usr/local/man/man5/
                # If the Ballast server will be run as a systemd service:
                install -m 644 etc/systemd/system/ballast.service /etc/systemd/system/
                install -m 644 etc/systemd/system/ballast.socket /etc/systemd/system/
